# Fuzzification

We propose a new mitigation approach, called Fuzzification, that helps developers effectively protect the released, binary-only software from attackers who are capable of applying state-of-the-art fuzzing techniques. It aims to hinder the fuzzing process from adversaries as much as possible, given a performance budget.

# Sourcoe code will be added soon
